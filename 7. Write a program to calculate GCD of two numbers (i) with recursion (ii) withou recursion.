7. Write a program to calculate GCD of two numbers (i) with recursion (ii) withou recursion.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to find GCD
int gcd_recursive(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd_recursive(b, a % b);
}

// Iterative function to find GCD
int gcd_iterative(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2;

    cout << "GCD (recursive) of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is " << gcd_recursive(num1, num2) << endl;
    cout << "GCD (iterative) of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is " << gcd_iterative(num1, num2) << endl;

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Enter two numbers: 48 18
GCD (recursive) of 48 and 18 is 6
GCD (iterative) of 48 and 18 is 6
